# Internships 101...

_...or rather, things I wish I knew before I started applying_

I'm probably not the most qualified person to write about this, as I'm only just starting my career. Yet, for some reason, I've been asked multiple times to share my experiences with applying for internships, interviewing, and landing jobs. I've given three talks on this topic and spoken with countless people about it, so I thought I'd finally write it down here.

          alt={`Project ${index + 1}`}

    ))}

While I'm not someone who's interned at every big tech company out there, I've had my fair share of experiences and conversations with others who've interned at various places.

  While I won't be covering the basics extensively here, you should still focus on creating a professional CV, writing tailored cover letters, practising LeetCode, building projects, attending hackathons, and preparing answers for behavioural questions.

Instead of repeating the same advice you've probably heard a thousand times, I'll share some tips I genuinely wish I'd known earlier—things that could have saved me a lot of time and missed opportunities.

## 0. Are you sure this is what you want?

Many people I've spoken with aren't even sure what they truly want. They often feel pressured to follow the crowd, especially in competitive fields like Computer Science, where everyone seems to chase the same prestigious tech jobs.

If you're studying CS, remember that your career options extend far beyond becoming a software engineer at a big tech company. You could explore research, academia, UX design, teaching, project management, or even entrepreneurship.

On the other hand, internships are a fantastic way to explore your interests. They allow you to experience a company firsthand and decide if it's the right fit for you.

As a CTO of a large company once awkwardly said in front of ~800 attendees at a hackathon:

> "Interning at a company is like making out with someone. You get to experience it and see if it's for you or not. So come make out with us."

(Looking back, this was probably one of the most uncomfortable things I've heard someone in their 50s say at a hackathon. But I digress.)

## 1. Make a website

Just do it.

Creating a personal website requires minimal effort but offers immense benefits. In the grand scheme of things, few activities provide as much return on investment as building your own website. You can set one up in less than an hour, and it will:

- Give you an online presence.
- Serve as a project you can discuss in interviews.
- Make you memorable to recruiters.

Even if you're aiming to be a back-end engineer, having a website is beneficial.

However, avoid these common pitfalls:

1. **Don't use a template.** Recruiters and hiring managers can spot templates easily. My manager at Spotify once mentioned that part of why they hired me was because my website clearly reflected my personality and originality.
2. **Don't plagiarise code.** When hiring the tech team for Hack the Burgh 2025, I rejected a candidate who claimed to have created a complex GLSL particle simulation, which turned out to be entirely copied.
3. **Don't be generic.** Your website is your chance to stand out. Showcase your personality while maintaining professionalism.

If you're convinced but unsure where to start, try writing some basic HTML and JavaScript, then deploy it using Netlify.

## 2. Be QUICK!

I only recently realised how crucial timing is—a grave mistake.

Companies aim to fill internship spots quickly to secure the best talent. Delaying your interviews or applications can cost you dearly.

I once postponed a final-round interview by a week due to university deadlines. Despite performing exceptionally well, I was informed that the last internship spot had just been filled. Instead, I was offered a spring week.

Looking back, prioritising the interview over a slightly better university grade would have been the smarter choice.

## 3. Interviewers are your friends

It's easy to view interviews as exams, but they're fundamentally different. While your technical skills and thought processes matter, interviewers also assess your personality and cultural fit.

Gayle Laakmann summarises this perfectly in her book, _Cracking the Coding Interview_:

> "Despite the questions on polymorphism and heaps and virtual machines, the question [interviewers] really want an answer to is: _Would I have a beer with this person?_"

Remember, interviewers are looking for someone they'd enjoy working alongside. Be yourself, be friendly, and show genuine enthusiasm.

## 4. Log it all

Keeping track of your internship applications and interviews is incredibly helpful. I recommend creating a simple spreadsheet or Gantt chart to log:

- Companies you've applied to.
- Application dates.
- Interview dates and outcomes.
- Feedback received.

After each interview, jot down notes about the questions asked, your responses, and any insights gained. These notes will be invaluable if you interview with the same company again, help friends applying later, or prepare for similar companies.

## 5. Research, Research, Research

Corporate websites rarely provide the full picture. Platforms like Reddit and Blind offer candid insights from current and former employees, helping you understand:

- Company culture and prestige.
- Work-life balance and expectations.
- Interview structures and common questions.

I've frequently changed my mind about applying to certain companies after reading honest reviews on Reddit. These platforms have also provided invaluable tips on interview preparation and company-specific insights.

## Feeling stressed?

Feeling overwhelmed or worried about rejection? Remember, rejection is a natural part of the process. Every rejection teaches you something valuable.

Everyone around you, including your idols, has faced rejection:

- **Tim Cook** was rejected from several roles before eventually becoming Apple's CEO.
- **Saphira Crystal** was rejected 11 times before finally joining RuPaul's Drag Race and becoming one of its strongest contestants.
- **Daniel Ek** was rejected by Google, motivating him to create Spotify.
- **Lady Gaga** was dropped by her first record label and faced months of rejection before releasing her breakthrough album, _The Fame_.
- My sister, twice as smart as me, has faced countless rejections from her dream roles but continues to learn and apply.
- Personally, I've been rejected at least 57 times since starting university—and probably more that I haven't recorded.

I encourage you to research your own idols' rejections. You'll quickly realise rejection is universal and often leads to greater opportunities.

## You've got this!

Go apply! Best of luck, fellow internaut.

Lastly, remember that first impressions matter. As Apple's marketing philosophy "Impute" suggests, people do judge a book by its cover. Make sure your first impression counts.
