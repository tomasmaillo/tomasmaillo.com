# Vibe-Check

Co-built with <Avatar url="https://unavatar.io/github/StanFlint" name="Stan Flint" link="https://stanflint.dev/" />, vibe-check is a Chrome Extension and Website that helps make presentations more interactive. Users can *react* and *comment* on the presentation in real-time. Presenters can see real-time statistics on the *vibe* of the room.

After a successful summer of development in 2023, we released the Chrome Extension, opened beta testing, and carried out some user testing.

## Origins

The night before [Hack The Burgh 2023](https://2023.hacktheburgh.com/) hackathon, some friends and I were in my living room complaining about the lack of interaction in our university lectures.

In simple terms, the conversation went like this:
> "I'm not sure if I'm the only one, but I find it hard to stay awake in lectures"

We found that lectures felt like low-quality YouTube videos and did not take advantage of the interactive potential that being in the same room as the lecturer offers.

## Hack The Burgh

Following on from that night's conversation, along with <Avatar url="https://unavatar.io/github/paulinasg" name="Paulina Gerchuk" link="https://paulinagerch.uk/" />, <Avatar url="https://unavatar.io/github/david14higgins" name="David Higgins" link="https://github.com/david14higgins" />, <Avatar url="https://unavatar.io/github/archieforster" name="Archie Forster" link="https://github.com/archieforster" />, <Avatar url="https://unavatar.io/github/wietsdev" name="Wietske Holwerda" link="https://wiets.dev/" /> and <Avatar url="https://unavatar.io/github/StanFlint" name="Stan Flint" link="https://stanflint.dev/" /> we decided to build a system that would help us stay awake in lectures.

With only 24 hours to build a proof of concept demo, we focused on the core features of the system. Here is where we got to:

  <Image src="/vc-htb.png" alt="Screenshot of Chrome tab showing the vibe-check website. Large vibe check logo on the left and a QR code on the right. Real-time reactions are visible on the bottom right." width={1990} height={2000} className="object-contain w-full h-64 bg-card rounded-lg" draggable={false}/>
  <p className="text-xs opacity-50 text-center m-0 mt-2">During our demo, judges could scan the QR code and open the client on their devices. As we gave the demo, they could react and comment on our presentation.</p>
</div>

<div className="relative w-full h-96 bg-card rounded-lg flex flex-col justify-center items-center p-12 my-6">
  <Image src="/vc-htb-phone.png" width={150} height={100} className="rounded-lg border-border border" />
  <p className="text-xs opacity-50 text-center m-0 mt-2">The audience can react and comment.</p>
</div>

The hackathon was a success. While we did win several smaller prizes, the nicest outcome was getting feedback directly from heads of schools and lecturers. They saw the potential of the system and wanted to see it developed further.

## V2

By the end of March 2023, <Avatar url="https://unavatar.io/github/StanFlint" name="Stan Flint" link="https://stanflint.dev/" /> and I decided to continue working on the project. We had clear ideas of what we wanted to build and how it could help university life. We called it V2.

We planned to showcase our progress and partner with lecturers in September of 2023, our next academic year.

  <p className="text-xs opacity-50 text-center m-0 mt-2">Presenter's dashboard mid-summer 2023</p>
</div>

Our timeline gave us a couple of months to build a real MVP. These included: 
- Deploy the extension to the Chrome Webstore.
- Build and deploy the website for presenters and audiences, including backend.
- Create a promotional website for lecturers to sign up for updates.

We used Svelte, NextJS, TailwindCSS, Digital Ocean.

I'll cover the coolest and most unique part of the puzzle:

## Monorepo

Stan pushed for a monorepo structure, a setup that allows code sharing across different parts of a project, such as between a server and a website. As a multiplayer game developer, Stan was quite fond of this approach because it enables consistent logic execution on both client and server sides. For instance, in multiplayer game development that he does, calculations for player movement need to be identical on both client devices and server.

Initially, I was skeptical when Stan suggested combining our Chrome Extension, Website, and Backend into a single repository. My concerns centered around potential complexity and size issues. My previous experience, including an internship at Spotify, had always involved separate repositories for backend and frontend.

However, my reservations were quickly dispelled. The monorepo structure proved to be a game-changer, offering benefits beyond my expectations. While sharing type definitions and helper functions across the three domains was useful, what truly amazed me was the ability to share Svelte components between the Website and the Chrome Extension. This eliminated the need for copying and pasting components or creating separate shared libraries.

The primary challenge was the extensive configuration and build scripts required to integrate the components smoothly. We created a custom `webpack.config.js` to enable a unified development experience. With a single `npm run dev` command, we could start and hot-reload the server, website, and extension simultaneously.

## Chrome Extension

Why not a desktop app?
Part of the reason to pick a Chrome Extension was that all computers in the University of Edinburgh have Chrome installed and administrators can install extensions without user interaction. Therefore, setup was trivial. As soon as a lecturer would open a computer to display slides, the extension would be installed and running.

It is true that a desktop app would be more versatile, (especially for those lecturers who prefer alternative browsers), but we estimated that 90% of lecturers already use Chrome's PDF viewer in full screen mode.
