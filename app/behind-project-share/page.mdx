# Behind Project Share

<a href="https://projectshare.comp-soc.com/" style={{ color: '#EB5D31' }}>Project Share</a> is a student society at the University of Edinburgh that I co-founded in Feb 2023 with three friends. Since it has slowly grown to over 100 members. 

## Huh? 

At the heart of Project Share is our bi-weekly meetup where we share our projects. They follow quite an informal setup. People just show up and can decide to share their projects. Simply stand up, plug in their laptop and show their project (...hence the name Project Share!).

On average, ~10 projects are shared each session. 

One of the projects I shared at Project Share was the Project Share website itself. Full circle!

## Design + Website

Project Share gave me quite a unique opportunity to experiment for several reasons:
1. Project Share did not have a theme.
2. I was the only developer. The other co-founders were working on their own projects.
3. I was the only designer. The other co-founders were not designers.
4. I was the only marketer. The other co-founders were not marketers.

As all projects have done, I have re-invented the website a few times and this is the story behind.

Personally, I think part of this informal approach is what makes it work, you never know who might show up or what they might share. We have had instances where people share about their robot hobby project, then they are immediately followed by someone talking about their amazing portfolio website and then ends with someone sharing about their new AI model. You never know what you might learn.

Project Share was thought to be for meeting people, and that I did
