# Paper: Enhancing Peer Feedback in MarkEd

*Inspired by a semester spent marking second-year students&apos; essays, I proposed my dissertation project aimed at improving assessment practices in education.*

Under the guidance of my amazing supervisors <Avatar name="Cristina Alexandru" link="https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/calexan4/" /> and <Avatar name="Aurora Constatin" link="https://sites.google.com/site/auroraconstantin/" />, we developed a tool addressing common issues in peer assessment. By combining structured moderation from human markers with AI-generated guidance, educators now have a toolkit for running more effective and reflective peer-review assignments.

The system was trialled during a large second-year course at the University of Edinburgh involving around 200 students. The results were really promising: notably, over 75% of students agreed that the AI-supported tools helped them reflect more deeply on the feedback they provided. The dissertation itself received a grade of *Outstanding (93%)*.

From this dissertation, we wrote a paper recently accepted for presentation at the UK and Ireland Computing Education Research (UKICER) 2025 conference, with publication forthcoming in the conference proceedings.
