# What I use

I think that a big chunk of being a developer is figuring out what tools to use. Yes, knowledge and being a team player are extremely important, but so is knowing what tools to use. Knowing how to approach a problem with the right tools is key.

I bet a coffee that if you give these tools an honest try, you'll fall in love just like I did. If they don't convince you, I'll buy you a coffee.

- [Arc Browser](https://arc.net/): Every person I have shown this browser to absolutely loves it. It's fast, it's beautiful, it just works. Built on Chromium, but re-skinned with a focus on usefulness.
- [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/): Replaces Spotlight on Mac. It's faster, more powerful and just works. Best part: install / create extensions. My favourites are *Show My IP*, *AirPods Mode Switch*, *Clipboard History*, *Color Picker* and *Just Play...* (to play music). The team behind Raycast is out of this world, some of the best developers and UX designers ever are working at Raycast, including <Avatar url="https://unavatar.io/twitter/peduarte" name="Pedro Duarte" link="https://ped.ro/" />.
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/): (Less well-known as ùïè). If you train your feed to only show you the best content, it's a great tool. But you have to ensure that you're only seeing the best content. Don't be afraid of smashing the "Not interested" button whenever the feed gets weird.
- [Apple Mac M<Latex children={"$x$"} /> Series](https://www.apple.com/mac/): Yes, I know they're more expensive than Windows alternatives. But if you spend most of your day in front of a computer anyways, you might as well spend a bit more to get an improved experience. I am proud to have converted a growing list of people from PC to Mac: <Avatar url="https://unavatar.io/github/khalidbelhadj" name="Khalid Belhadj" link="https://khalidbelhadj.github.io/portfolio/" />, <Avatar url="https://unavatar.io/github/dprRoberta" name="Roberta Po≈°i≈´naitƒó" link="https://robertaposiunaite.com/" />, <Avatar url="https://unavatar.io/github/dhamedbarghi" name="Dorna Hamed Barghi" link="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dhamedbarghi/" />, <Avatar url="https://unavatar.io/github/paulinasg" name="Paulina Gerchuk" link="https://paulinagerch.uk/" /> and <Avatar url="https://unavatar.io/github/wietsdev" name="Wietske Holwerda" link="https://wiets.dev/" />.
- [ReadCV](https://read.cv/explore): Incredibly talented people share their work by adding it to their *CV*. The `/explore` page contains a curated list of the latest work from people you've never heard of. If you are looking for inspiration and meeting new people, this is the place to be. The creator <Avatar url="https://unavatar.io/github/andychung" name="Andy Chung" link="https://andychung.me/" /> is worth a follow. 
- [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/): VSCode fork that integrates AI to every part of your workflow. The context window for code generation is not only based on the current file, but also on the entire project. Super useful for quickly getting adding features to projects.
- [Grepper](https://www.grepper.com/): Adds snippets to Google search results. You can create your own snippets and upvote/downvote snippets. Almost like a pseudo-Reddit right on your search results. Extremely useful for repetitive queries that you don't want to open a website for. Eg: "undo last commit git", "alphabet"...
- [UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com/): Monitor uptime of your endpoints. Free plan is extremely generous and checks endpoints every 5 minutes!
- [Web Interface Guidelines](https://interfaces.rauno.me/) by <Avatar url="https://unavatar.io/twitter/raunofreiberg" name="Rauno Freiberg" link="https://rauno.me/" />: Useful checklist when creating interfaces. Reminds you how to build smooth, accessible and elegant interfaces.
- [Unavatar](https://unavatar.io/): Smoothly retrieve avatar pictures of people. Given a username on a platform, the service provides their avatar picture. If a picture is updated, so will the avatar served by Unavatar.

I will keep adding more tools as I discover/remember them :{")"}
